This project uses:
    1 x ESP32 
    2 x ADS712 current sensor modules
        --> Solar panel In
        --> Load Out
    1 x Current shunt for 20A DC-DC charger
    1 x DS18B20 temperature sensor
    1 x LCD screen

The requirements for this project are:
    1. Having a power monitoring system that is capable of working offline (ie no internet).
    2. Function as a wireless access point (WAP), ie acts like an offline server where stored information and variables are callable to any mobile device.
    3. Have the necessary detail on a large LCS screen so to reduce reliance on a mobile device.
    4. Firmware updatable over WiFi.
    5. Graphs to understand trends.
    6. Temperature guage for fun (and they are so cheap why not).
